Activeconnect
=============

Activeconnect provides a **passwordless** authentication system for web and native applications.

This document describes how to get started integrating Activeconnect into your application.

Activeconnect provides a REST API and libraries for popular languages.
While it is possible to make direct calls to the Activeconnect REST API, we recommend that clients use our libraries.
